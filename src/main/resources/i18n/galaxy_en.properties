star.explanation=A star system, which will likely have colonisable planets.
space.explanation=Outer space, without significant terrain features. This type of sector offers no bonuses or penalties.
asteroids.explanation=Engine speed is reduced by 2 to a minimum of one within these sectors. A ship using warp to move cannot pass through asteroid fields.
volatile-nebula.explanation=These nebula are comprised of easily ignited and especially explosive gasses. Energy and Explosive weapons gain a +2 bonus to attacks in volatile nebula.
shrouding-nebula.explanation=The gasses in these nebula are particularly disruptive to sensors. All sensor checks in or through shrouding nebula sectors take a -2 penalty.
resonating-nebula.explanation=The gasses in these nebula are extremely stable, and transmit energy easily. Sensor checks made from within resonating nebula gain a +2 bonus.
ionic-nebula.explanation=These nebula are particularly odd, and do not have any defined traits. Instead, ionic nebula can offer random bonuses and penalties.
rifts.explanation=Breaches in time and space, rifts require warp to pass through them. However, ships that enter a rift sector may find they do not come out where they intended to.
gravity-well.explanation=These sectors feature a particularly dense source of gravity, possibly a black hole or other phenomenon. Within a gravity well ships take a -1 penalty to engine speed, while Solid weapons gain a +2 bonus due to a forced increase in their density. 
cluster.explanation=A cluster of stars lies at the center of the galaxy.
